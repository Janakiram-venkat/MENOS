# MENOS

A quantum circuit simulation compiler and runtime. MENOS analyzes a circuit, estimates candidate execution strategies, chooses a plan, and runs it on the engine that fits the workload.

## What is MENOS?

MENOS is a high-performance quantum circuit simulator built as a **compiler and runtime system**. Instead of pushing every circuit through one fixed algorithm, it:

1. **Analyzes** the circuit (structure, entanglement, locality, what output you asked for),
2. **Estimates** what each candidate execution strategy would cost,
3. **Plans** by choosing the cheapest feasible strategy, and
4. **Executes** that plan, monitoring it against your time budget and replanning if reality disagrees with the estimate.

It is also a **Qiskit `BackendV2`** and **`EstimatorV2`**, so existing Qiskit code runs against it without modification.

## Your first circuit

This is the complete program. It is an executable file in the repository's `examples/` directory and is run by the test suite.

<<< @/../examples/bell_state.py

::: info Status of this release
MENOS is at version 1.1.0. Phases 1 to 17 are complete, and Phase 18 adds native Windows (x64, MSVC, CPU only). The verification suites run on Linux x86-64 and on Windows x64; see [Supported Platforms](/introduction/supported-platforms) for exactly what that means.
